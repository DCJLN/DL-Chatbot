# Dee Learning - Final Project
In order to run the code, please follows the steps:
	* Install the conda environnment: conda env create -f chatbot_env.yml
	* Download the datasets, the weights and the Glove embedding with this link (too big to be included in the submission): https://we.tl/t-6YgDteTrQg
	* run the file final_chatbot.py with either the argument "-train" or "-talk".

Note that the file "chatbot_try_3layers_BiDir" is, as mentionned in the report, just there to show that the experiment of 3 layers
and Bidirectionnal LSTM has well been implemented.
